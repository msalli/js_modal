      <p class="content-text"><span class="text-opener">I</span> believe in comfort. If you don't feel comfortable in your clothes, it's hard to think of anything else. I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes. It's really easy to get colors right. It's really hard to get black - and neutrals - right. Black is certainly a color but it's also an illusion. I have a fantastic relationship with money. I use it to buy my freedom. I get ideas about what's essential when packing my suitcase.</p>

      <p class="content-text">It's a philosophy of life. A practice. If you do this, something will change, what will change is that you will change, your life will change, and if you can change you, you can perhaps change the world. Fashion is always of the time in which you live. It is not something standing alone. But the grand problem, the most important problem, is to rejeuvenate women. To make women look young. Then their outlook changes. They feel more joyous. I've always tried to push myself technically and to push myself visually. That's been part of the journey. I love you if you love me. Fashion moves so quickly that, unless you have a strong point of view, you can lose integrity.</p>
